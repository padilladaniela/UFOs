# UFOs

# Overview Of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

## Summary

There are two drawbacks to the design. One drawback is is trying to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described in the data. Another drawback is that we don't have any witness data. The recommendations I would recommend is to gather more data to provide such as witness accounts and the other recommendation would be adding more filter such as length of sighting.
